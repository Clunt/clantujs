# Advanced Example

This example uses Webpack to bundle the app, and uses vue-loader to enable single file Vue components. Note this app is also used for end-to-end testing, so some of the fake timeouts are made particularly long to ensure the tests pass consistently.


### Running the Example

``` bash
# at repo root
npm install
# serve at localhost:8080
npm run serve-example
```
